## 1. Introduction
Cent Wise Dollar Wise is a desktop application for money management, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This application aims to help NUS hostel students manage their financial situation and track their spending efficiently. 
This developer guide provides information on the architecture and design of the application. It will not only help you get started as a Cent Wise Dollar Wise contributor, but that you will find useful to refer to even if you are already a contributor of this project. 

## 2. Setting Up
### 2.1 Prerequisites
- JDK 11 <br>
- IntelliJ IDE <br>
Note: IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. <br>
Note: Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to File > Settings > Plugins to re-enable them.

### 2.2 Setting Up the Project in your Computer
The following are the steps to set up the project on your computer:
1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ. If you are not on the welcome screen, click File > Close Project to close the existing project dialog first.
3. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle.
4. Click Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure.
5. Click New…​ and find the directory of the JDK.
6. Click Import Project.
7. Locate the build.gradle file and select it. Click OK
8. Click Open as Project
9. Click OK to accept the default settings
10. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message. This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

### 2.3 Verifying the Setup
The following are the steps to verify your setup:
1. Run the seedu.duke.Duke and try a few commands.
2. Run the tests and ensure all the tests pass.

## 3. Design
### 3.1 Architecture
![image](images/architecture.png) <br>

The architecture diagram above explains the high-level design of the application. Below is a quick overview of each component:

`Main`: Initializes spending list at app launch and coordinates the interaction between other components

`Data`: Stores the data collected from the user

`Storage`: Reads data from and writes data to the hard disk

`Ui`: Interacts with the user

`Command`: Executes the user command or system-issued command

`Parser`: Analyzes the user command

`Utilities`: Contains classes that are used by multiple components

**How the Architecture Components Interact with Each Other** <br>

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other when the user issues a general command. <br>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45732128/97735507-62c0d580-1b15-11eb-9f14-aab54bf5b29d.png" align="center"> <br>


### 3.2 UI Component
This component, consisting of the `Ui` class, is responsible for receiving user input and displaying appropriate output messages for the user. This includes error messages, warning messages, encouragement quotes, and messages that indicate if a command is successfully executed. 

### 3.3 Parser Component
Parser component is responsible for interpreting given input as a command.  It verifies that the format complies with [User Guide](UserGuide.md) specification. Then, it matches the appropriate command or error, and formats the provided arguments into parameters for internal methods.

Each command can take either no argument or some arguments. Commands taking no arguments will call `checkRemainingCommands()` to verify correct input format. Commands with arguments will extend `Parser` superclass and implement 2 methods:

* `Parser()` to initialise `Parser` subclass with the expected arguments for the detected command
* `parse(String[] args)` verifies argument format and returns the appropriate `Exception` or `Command` subclass instance with their formatted arguments.

### 3.4 Command Component
Every command that a user can input into the application is represented by an object that extends the abstract class `Command`. In addition, hidden commands that do not require user inputs also extends from the same abstract class `Command`. `Command` contains some basic methods that are shared by all types of commands, including:
* `execute()`, which is called after setting up the object appropriately, to perform the action requested by the user; and
* `isExit()`, which returns a boolean that indicates whether the program should terminate after the command is executed.

The following sections classify the `Command`s into different types based on their functionality within the application.

#### 3.4.1 CLI `Command`s related to Spending List
The following class diagram describes the CLI `Command`s specifically related to the spending list. <br>

<img src="images/CommandsSpendingListClass.png" width="600" align="center"> <br>

#### 3.4.2 CLI `Command`s related to Repayment List
The following class diagram describes the CLI `Command`s specifically related to the repayment list. <br>

<img src="images/CommandsRepaymentListClass.png" width="500" align="center"> <br>

#### 3.4.3 CLI `Command`s related to Budget
The following class diagram describes the CLI `Command`s specifically related to the budget. <br>

<img src="images/CommandsBudgetClass.png" width="500" align="center"> <br>

#### 3.4.4 General CLI `Command`s 
The following class diagram describes general CLI `Command`s that apply to the whole application. <br>

<img src="images/GeneralCLICommandsClass.png" width="400" align="center"> <br>

#### 3.4.5 Hidden `Command`s
The following class diagram describes the hidden commands within the program. <br>

<img src="images/HiddenCommandsClass.png" width="600" align="center"> <br>

### 3.5 Data Component
This component holds the data of the application, including the `SpendingList`, `RepaymentList` and `Budget` class in the memory.

#### 3.5.1 Spending List
The SpendingList class stores a list of `Item` objects that the user has spent. The `SpendingList` does not depend on Ui, Parser and Storage components. 

below shows a class diagram of how `SpendingList` interacts with other classes. <br>

<img src="images/spendingListClass.png" width="400" align="center">

#### 3.5.2 Repayment List
The RepaymentList class stores a list of `Repay` objects. Similar to SpendingList class, RepaymentList class does not depend on other components. 

below shows a class diagram of how `RepaymentList` interacts with other classes. <br>

<img src="images/repaymentListClass.png" width="400" align="center">

#### 3.5.3 Budget
The Budget class stores the budget in the specified currency and the date it was updated. Similar to SpendingList class, Budget class does not 
depend on other components. 

below shows a class diagram of how `Budget` interacts with other classes. <br>

<img src="images/budgetClass.png" width="400" align="center">

### 3.6 Storage Component
Storage component persists user data across sessions by storing data in a `.json` file. To avoid coupling between unrelated components (e.g. `Ui` and `Item`), objects are persisted by reflection of their variables and methods. Thus, only `SpendingList`, `RepaymentList` and `Budget` maintain instances of `Storage` to trigger writes to file upon changes in their memory.

Since this component relies on the external package `com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6` for reflection, we encapsulate gson methods in the following class diagram: <br>

<img src="images/storageClass.png" width="400" align="center">

## 4. Implementation
### 4.1 Add Feature
`SpendingList`, `SpendingListCategoriser` and `Ui` facilitate this feature. The Add feature is able to add a new item into the spending list. It implements the following operations:
* `AmountConverter#updateAmount` → converts amount to SGD
* `AmountConverter#updateCurrency` → updates currency to SGD
* `SpendingList#addItem` → adds item into the spending list
* `Ui#printAdd` → prints the message that the item is successfully added into the spending list
* `SpendingListCategoriser#execute`→ categorises the item in the spending list
* `WarnCommand#execute` → prints a warning message if total spending amount approaches the threshold of 90% of the budget limit or when the total spending amount exceeds the budget limit

Below shows an example of usage:
1. User types `add -c food -d beer -s USD 10` to add beer into the spending list
2. The `add` command calls `AddCommand#execute`
3. `AddCommand#execute` calls the following operations in order:
   1. `AmountConverter#updateAmount` to convert the amount “10” to SGD
   2. `AmountConverter#updateCurrency` to update the currency from “USD” to “SGD”
   3. `SpendingList#addItem` to add beer into the spending list
   4. `Ui#printAdd` to print a message if beer is successfully added into the spending list
   5. `SpendingListCategoriser#execute` to categorise beer under the food category of the spending list
   6. `WarnCommand#execute` to print a warning message if required
   
The following sequence diagram illustrates how this feature works. <br>

* `SpendingList#deleteItem` → deletes a particular entry of the spending list
* `SpendingList#clearAllItems` → clears all entries of the spending list
* `Ui#printClearAllSpendingList` → prints the message that all entries in the spending list are cleared
* `Ui#printClearIndex` → prints the message that an entry is cleared from either the repayment list or the spending list
* `Ui#printPurgeData` → prints the message that all data is cleared

Below shows an example of usage:
1. User types `clear -s 1` to clear the first entry in the spending list.
2. ClearSpendingListCommand calls `ClearSpendingListCommand#execute`, which calls the following operations in order:
   1. `SpendingList#clearAllItems` to clear all items in the spending list and saves the updated spending list in storage.
   2. `Ui#printClearAllSpendingList` to print a message if the spending list is cleared successfully
   
The following sequence diagram illustrates how clearing a spending list works. <br>

<img src="images/ClearCommand.png" width="400" align="center"> <br>

### 4.3 Edit Feature
`SpendingList`, `AmountConverter`, `DecimalFormatter` and `Ui` facilitate this feature. The Edit feature is able to edit the existing items in the spending list.

<img src="images/SetBudgetCommand.png" width="700" align="center"> <br>

### 4.6 Warn Feature
`Budget`, `SpendingList` and `Ui` facilitate this feature. The Warn feature is able to warn the user when the total 
spending amount approaches the threshold of 90% of the budget limit or when the total spending amount exceeds 
the budget limit. It implements the following operations:
* `Budget#getCurrency` → retrieves the corresponding currency for the budget
* `Budget#getBudgetLimit` → retrieves the budget limit
* `SpendingList#getCurrentAmount` → gets the total amount of spending in the spending list
* `Ui#printApproachingWarningMessage` → prints the warning message that the spending 
is approaching the budget limit (i.e. exceeds the threshold value of 90% of the budget limit but not yet exceed it), with 
the amount remaining
* `Ui#printExceedingWarningMessage` → prints the warning message that the spending has exceeded the budget limit

Below shows an example of usage:
1. User adds the spending to the spending list after setting the budget limit
2. The `add` command calls `WarnCommand#execute` to check if the user approaches or exceeds the budget 
limit 

The following sequence diagram illustrates how this feature works. <br>

<img src="images/WarnCommand.png" width="700" align="center"> <br>

### 4.7 Repay Feature

given a date. It implements the following operations:
* `Item#getDate` → gets the date when user spent on the item
* `Item#getAmount` → gets the amount spent on the item
* `SpendingList#getSpendingAmountTime` → gets the total amount spent during a period
* `SpendingList#getSpendingAmountCategory` → gets the total amount spent of a given category

Below shows an example of usage:

1. User executes the `summary 2020` command to get the amount spent during year 2020.
2. The `summary` command will first update the current currency symbol.
3. The `summary` command calls `SpendingList#getSpendingAmountTime` which checks the spending date of every item
stored in the memory.
4. If the item is spent during year 2020, the amount spent will be summed up.
5. The `summary` command will also call `SpendingList#getSpendingAmountCategory` to sum up the expenses in each
category during the year 2020.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how this feature works.<br>

<img src="images/SummaryCommand.png" width="700" align="center"> <br>

### 4.9 Reminder Feature

total expenditure of the current week, starting on Monday. It implements the following operations:
* `SpendingList#getSpendingAmountTime` → gets the total amount spent during a period
* `WarnCommand#execute` → gives out warnings if overspending

Below shows an example of usage:

1. User starts the application.
2. The `ReminderCommand` will be instantiated. The dates of the current week (starting from Monday) will be saved to a list.
3. The `reminder` command will first update the current currency symbol.
4. In the `ReminderCommand#execute(Data, Ui)`, a check will be done to see if there is any budget being set by the user.
    * If no budget is being set, the total expenditure of current week will be tallied up. 
    * If there is, `WarnCommand#execute(Data, Ui)` will be called first before tallying up the expenditure. 

The following sequence diagram illustrates how this feature works. <br>

<img src="images/reminder.png" width="700" align="center"> <br>

### 4.10 Encouragement Feature

## 5. Dev Ops
### 5.1 Build Automation
This project uses Gradle for build automation and dependency management. <br>

Given below are how to use Gradle for some important project tasks: <br>

* `clean`: Deletes the files created during the previous build tasks (e.g. files in the build folder). e.g. ./gradlew clean
* `shadowJar`: Uses the ShadowJar plugin to creat a fat JAR file in the build/lib folder, if the current file is outdated. e.g. ./gradlew shadowJar
* `run`: Builds and run the program. 
* `runShadow`: Builds the application as a fat JAR, and then runs it.
* `checkstyleMain`: Runs the code style check for the main code base. 
* `checkstyleTest`: Runs the code style check for the test code base.
* `test`: Runs all tests.
  * `./gradlew test` — Runs all tests
  * `./gradlew clean test` — Cleans the project and runs tests

### 5.2 Continuous Integration (CI)
This project uses GitHub Actions for CI. The project comes with the necessary GitHub Actions configurations files (in the .github/workflows folder). 

### 5.3 Making a release
Here are the steps to create a new release:

1. Generate a fat JAR file using Gradle by using the command `gradlew shadow` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean shadowJar`).
2. Find the JAR file in the `build/libs` directory.
3. Tag the repository with a new version number.
4. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/). Upload the JAR file you created.

### 5.4 Coverage Reporting
We use the IntelliJ IDEA’s coverage analysis tool for coverage reporting. A video tutorial on how to use this tool can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYzZvyA2ik&feature=youtu.be).
