## **1. Introduction**
Welcome to Cent Wise Dollar Wise User Guide! Cent Wise Dollar Wise is a desktop application for money management, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This application aims to help NUS hostel students manage their financial situation and track their spending efficiently. 
This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the applicationâ€™s installation process and command features. 

## **2. Quick Start**
1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest version of `Duke` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F14-2/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to a home folder you would like to use.
4. Open a terminal in that home folder and enter java -jar duke.jar to begin.
5. Type the desired command and press Enter to execute it. Tips: entering help will display the help window with a list of commands that could be executed.

Refer to the [Command Features](#3-command-features) below for details of each command.

## **3. Command Features**
In this section, specific information about each command will be explained. This includes the purpose of each command, and how it is formatted.

Before we begin, do take note of the following information which applies to all commands:

* The format of a command line is as follows: `command DESCRIPTION [-f DESCRIPTION] -f DESCRIPTION1 DESCRIPTION2`

    * `command` in lowercase can be any command in this section, such as `add` or `spending list`. You must specify it first in the command line.

    * `DESCRIPTION` in uppercase is a description of the argument you should provide. Each word in the description corresponds to the expected argument. 

        * **Example**: `export PATH` asks for the file path to export your data to.

        * **Example**: `add -s CURRENCY AMOUNT` asks for the added currency and amount, to be separated by spaces. One valid command line is `add -s SGD 1.00`.

    * `-f` is a flag. Arguments are either flagged or unflagged. You must specify unflagged arguments after the command and flagged arguments after unflagged arguments.

        * **Example**: One valid command line for `edit INDEX [-d NEW_DESCRIPTION] [-c CATEGORY]` is `edit 1 -c Food -d Rice`, which edits the category and description of item at index 1.

        * `INDEX` in `edit INDEX [-d NEW_DESCRIPTION] [-c CATEGORY]` is an unflagged argument and must be specified in the given order (after `edit`).

        * `CATEGORY` and `NEW_DESCRIPTION` in `edit INDEX [-d NEW_DESCRIPTION] [-c CATEGORY]` are flagged arguments and can be specified in any order after `INDEX`.

    * Arguments are either optional or required. Optional arguments are enclosed in square brackets (i.e. `[]`), while required arguments are not.

        * Do not enter `[]` within your command line. It is used only in documentations.

        * You must specify required arguments to run the command.

        * You can specify any combination of optional arguments, including none of them unless otherwise stated.
    
* The abbreviation of `MONTH` is case-insensitive. The system accepts the English abbreviation of `MONTH` with at least 3 characters. 

    * Example: `Jul` or `july` for July, but not `Ju` or `007`.

* If you specify `-a` all flag, do not specify the optional arguments `YEAR` and `MONTH`.

* The system only supports three different currencies including SGD, USD and CNY as of `v2.1`.

* The default currency of the system is SGD. Only after calling `convert` feature will the default currency will be changed to the currency you have converted to.

* There are 7 categories of spending items. If you did not specify a category or categorise an item in a category not within the first 6, the item will default to Others:
    1. Education
    1. Entertainment
    1. Food
    1. Health
    1. Transportation
    1. Utilities
    1. Others (default)
